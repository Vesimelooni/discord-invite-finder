# discord-invite-finder
Simple Discord invite finder using python3 with multiprocessing.
<p>
How it works:
</p>
<ul>

<li>
Generate random link
</li>
<li>
Connect to the website https://discord.com/invite/ (random string)
</li>
<li>
Search for the server name. (name cannot be like invite, discord etc.
</li>
</ul>
<b>DISCLAIMER</b>
  <p>On a normal computer, it's almost impossible to find random discord links by force, so this program is mostly useless. Just a test on network stuff etc.</p>
